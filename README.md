# Heartware 

### About the Project

Heartware is a pacemaker – a safety critical implant – which regulates a user’s heart rate by sending electrical pulses to the heart’s nodes. Such devices are used to treat conditions such as arrhythmia and bradycardia, where a patient’s heart is unable to sufficiently regulate its own rate. 

Please read the documentation for more details.

The current version of Heartware utilizes model-based code generation and a Python GUI to achieve the following features:
- 4 unique pacemaker modes (AOO, VOO, AAI, VVI)
- Desktop application for a DCM (Device Control Monitor)
